NGXSMK Wallet is an advanced, **zero-knowledge, offline-first secure desktop vault** designed to keep your digital identity, passwords, credentials, secrets, and private documents completely encrypted and under your exclusive control. Built using modern technologies like **Tauri v2**, **Rust**, and **React 19**, it ensures absolute privacy by storing all vault data locally on your device with no cloud dependencies, no telemetry, and no tracking.

### All Releases

See the [Releases](https://github.com/NGXSMK/ngxsmk-wallet/releases) page for all versions and changelogs.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the installer for your platform from the links above
2. **Install** and launch NGXSMK Wallet
3. **Create** your master password on first run
4. **Save** your recovery key in a safe place
5. **Start** adding your passwords, identities, and documents

All data is stored locally in your platform's app data directory. Your master password is the only key.

## Building from Source

Building from source requires the Rust backend which is proprietary. Pre-built binaries are the recommended way to use NGXSMK Wallet.

If you have a licensed backend, see [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) for instructions.

---

## Security

NGXSMK Wallet is designed with security as the primary concern:

- **Zero-knowledge architecture** — encryption keys are derived from your master password at runtime and never stored
- **AES-256-GCM** — all vault data encrypted at rest
- **Argon2id** — memory-hard key derivation resists GPU/ASIC attacks
- **Secure memory** — cryptographic material zeroed on lock/exit
- **Constant-time operations** — mitigates timing side-channel attacks
- **Offline-first** — no network requests, no telemetry, no cloud dependence
